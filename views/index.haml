  Hi there! I've noticed a bunch of jobs have started failing and i will try to take a look but i'm not sure i know how to fix this.
  I also added a link to failed jobs so you can easily see when they fail, jobs that haven't been processed yet will also end up there until they are processed. Anyway, i have gotten no comments or anything like that from anyone, doesn't anybody have anything they want to improve or say?

  I have just added pagination and commenting to replays. The server is currently experiencing a yet undiagnosed hardware error i believe might be disk(s). It's a very old machine that even has IDE disks. Hoping to fix it somehow. 
  
  I might be getting a dual xeon box with 4GB ram from a friend. That'll do eh? :D
