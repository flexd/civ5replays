  I've been a bit busy lately so there has been no time to work on the code, and i actually haven't got much clue what you guys want from this? I've been meaning to add in options to change the size of the generated page among other things and perhaps comments for each game? (sign in through facebook/twitter perhaps?).
  %a{:href=> 'http://twitter.com/flexd'} Find me on twitter.  
%p Simply upload a replay of a finished civilization 5 game and a HTML page will be generated for your replay :-)
%form{:action => '/upload', :enctype => 'multipart/form-data', :method => 'POST'}
  %p<
    Replay description/name to be identified with in links.
    %input{:type => 'text',:id => 'description', :name => 'description'}
  %p<
    Replay file: 
    %input{:type => 'file',:id => 'file', :name => 'file'}
  %p<
    Optional map file: 
    %input{:type => 'file',:id => 'mapfile', :name => 'mapfile'}
  %p<
    %input{:type => 'submit', :value => 'Upload'}
